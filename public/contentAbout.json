    "Originally from Tel Aviv Omer Eilam began his academic studies with a Bachelor degree in Neuroscience and later continued to a PhD in Computational Biology and research of the Human Microbiome. In parallel he started a Bachelor's degree in music composition and later moved to The Netherlands to study electronic music in The Institute of Sonology. Focusing on the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen he acquired a Master's degree with an electronic music realization of Stockhausen's composition TIERKREIS. In 2017 he began training and working as a sound projectionist and synthesizer creator for the 'Aus LICHT' production in Holland Festival 2019.",
    "Beginning in 2019 Omer Eilam became active in the environmental movement, co-founding Extinction Rebellion's online activist radio, helping to organize the conference 'Breathing with the Climate Crisis' at the Goetheanum in Switzerland, writing several essays about the relationship between humans and nature and composing a piece dedicated to the activists who defend the Hambach Forest from destruction.",
    "Alongside his compositional praxis he gives workshops to groups which aim to balance individual self expression and group connection. By way of diverse musical games participants are invited to explore their individual voice while at the same time find different ways to harmonise with the group.",
    "Some of his collaborators include Kathinka Pasveer, Suzanne Stephens, Paul Hübner, Juan Verdaguer and Hagai Yodan. His work was featured in Hošek Contemporary, MOOS Space, IN-SONORA, The Church of Interbeing, The Goetheanum and CTM Berlin, among other places.",
