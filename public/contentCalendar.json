    "eventText": "A special concert featuring new compositions from my upcoming album Imaginary Ecosystems. Most of the music has been composed in the last two years and was greatly influenced by the events of October 7th 2023 and the ensuing war in Gaza. The concert will be played through a dedicated 4-channel surround sound system which puts the listeners in the midst of an immersive space of moving sounds. It invites the audience to an intense listening and reflection upon current and historical themes."
