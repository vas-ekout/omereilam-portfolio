    "eventText": "On the 11th and 12th of October I will offer a weekend introductory course on electronic music together with Gisbert Schürig at the Volkshochschule Pankow (Berlin). The course provides an overview of the diversity of electronic music in its various manifestations. We will demonstrate characteristic approaches such as sampling, synthesis and modulation, highlighting similarities and differences between avant-garde and pop culture. How are similar methods used by artists such as Karlheinz Stockhausen and Daft Punk? For each of the techniques presented, there will be opportunities to explore them in practice using provided instruments.

    "eventText": "A special concert featuring new compositions from my upcoming album Imaginary Ecosystems. Most of the music has been composed in the last two years and was greatly influenced by the events of October 7th 2023 and the ensuing war in Gaza. The concert will be played through a dedicated 4-channel surround sound system which puts the listeners in the midst of an immersive space of moving sounds. It invites the audience to an intense listening and reflection upon current and historical themes."
