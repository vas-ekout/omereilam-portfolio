        "text": "The Art of Listening is a workshop series on electronic and experimental music offered to the general public at the Pablo Neruda library in Berlin. Unlike traditional lectures which focus on the history of the field or the techniques used by composers and artists, the focus is on the experience of listening itself and thus facilitate an alternative way of listening to music."

        "text": "By alternating between sound and our inner experience, we discover new musical languages and new ways of listening to them. Topics range from Karlheinz Stockhausen's spiritual serialism to musique concr√®te and Luigi Nono's musical activism."

        "text": "A total of 6-8 workshops will be facilitated by Omer Eilam on behalf of <a href='https://www.lev-berlin.de/'>lev-berlin</a>, a collective of musicians organizing projects of electronic music education for the general public. A pilot workshop took place on April 3rd. Subsequent meetings will take place during the second half of 2025."
