        "text": "The idea for the project started around 2015 when I was studying in The Institute of Sonology in The Hague and experimenting with generative music patterns. Like many other electronic musicians I was excited about the possibility of using computer algorithms to govern the 'behaviour' a certain sound exhibits. Based on predefined rules, different parameters of a sound – e.g. its timbre, pitch, loudness, etc. – can change over time in a process that tries to mimic the behaviour of real organisms in nature. When applying this idea to several sound organisms at once and letting them influence the behaviour of each other one can think of this scenario as an ecosystem of sounds"
      },
      {
        "text": "After an initial success I noticed that even though the sound organisms do continually change over time, these changes were somewhat insignificant and it felt that the ecosystem remained largely static. A breakthrough moment came years later when I incorporated the possibility to interact with the sound organisms in real-time. At last the ecosystem was no longer static but through my interaction it came to life. Composing the sound organisms was then like creating a landscape of possibilities, while interacting with them was exploring this landscape."
      },
      {
        "text": "Following these developments I used the Imaginary Ecosystems framework in several live improvised concerts, among which were two performances which took place during the Küchensessions series in Hamburg in 2024. The results were recorded and later developed into two new compositions: Anthroposophia and Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones."
      },
      {
        "text": "From a musical point of view, the two Imaginary Ecosystems compositions are an interesting case study for the relationship between composition and improvisation in electronic music. The working process began through an improvisation with the sound material, similar to the way organisms in nature playfully relate to each other. This allowed the sound organisms to evolve and interact in ever changing ways. The second step of recording the results was like taking snapshots or timelapses of these ecosystems. Finally, the concluding compositional process could be likened to sculpting in musical time: some segments were removed, others adjusted, a narrative incorporated and assembled into a musical whole. For example, one of the pieces contains an apocalyptic prophecy from the Book of Ezekiel which symbolizes both destruction and the potential for regeneration. The initial soundscape is sparse and fragmentary, consisting of brittle whispers suggesting aridity, decay and dissolution. Using digital synthesis techniques, these sound fragments are reconstructed, gradually forming richer textures that symbolize the process of revival."

        "text": "In August 2020 I spent a day at the Hambach Forest together with a group of activists who were occupying the forest and trying to save it from destruction for the sake of coal mining. At that time I was an active member of Extinction Rebellion in The Netherlands and wanted to witness firsthand the collapse of our natural systems as well as the struggle of the environmental movement in order to prevent that from happening."
      },
      {
        "text": "As the largest open pit mine in Europe, the forest and its occupation became a symbol of resistance and an inspiration for many activists. When I arrived there it was two years after a German court ruled that the clearance of Hambach Forest by RWE AG had to stop immediately until further evidence could be evaluated. While I expected to find highly motivated activists and “tree hugging hippies” I was totally unprepared to face people whose lives were so utterly different from anything I’ve encountered until then. In retrospect I realized how living in such close proximity to a place of destruction and violent opposition can cause deep scars in the human soul and make a person feel extremely alienated from their surroundings."

        "text": "While originally I planned to stay in the forest for several weeks, having contracted food poisoning on the first night from forest supplies that were long past their due date, I had to flee immediately and seek medical attention. Back in civilisation I wrote a text which tried to capture those 24 hours and put them in a broader context of the environmental movement and of human society. I later recorded that text hoping to one day use it as part of my music."
      },
      {
        "text": "Two years into the future I moved to live in Germany and, after several years of hiatus from music, I renovated a small garden house and made it into my studio. I revisited the Hambach text and started working on a new composition. Armed by a variety of synthesizers, sounds from natural habitats, bird calls and soundbites from climate-related newscasts and environmental movement demonstrations, the text provided a guide to capture the spirit of the forest and its inhabitants in music."
      },
      {
        "text": "Since my time at the forest a law was passed to preserve it from further destruction which was a clear victory for the environmental movement. Yet surrounding areas, for example the town of Lützerath, were still eradicated to make way for the expansion of the Garzweiler surface mine. When I revisited the forest in 2022 the atmosphere there was different. Some of the old occupants were still on site but the majority of people were occasional passersby who wanted to camp in the forest. In a conversation with one of them I learned that even though the forest was officially 'saved' the damage created by the digging of the coal mine depleted the ground water to levels that cannot sustain its survival. Together with increasingly unstable climate conditions the remaining part of the forest will probably perish by the end of the century."
      },
      {
        "text": "This picture of a dying forest is sadly not limited to Hambach. In Falkensee, just one hundred meters from our house, there is another forest that is dying. Every year I can see the increasing number of trees that have fallen as a result of draughts and of monoculture plantations that were never sustainable in the first place. And yet, each fallen tree is also a wake-up call for the person who passes it by, if only they notice it. If only they realize how deeply connected they are to that tree. For both the tree and the passerby are organs in the body of this Earth, each having to fulfil a unique function to maintain and promote Life."

My starting point was the movement of the planets around the sun: their distance, their speed, their angle, etc. These parameters were then used to guide the curation of the sounds where, put simply, each planet corresponds to a single continually evolving sound with its unique frequency and spatial movement. Using dedicated software these spatial trajectories were simulated in sound and rendered in multichannel format that corresponds to any given loudspeaker arrangement."

In addition to that, as a specialist in electronic music production, together with Juan Verdaguer, I was in charge of creating the synthesizer sounds for all of the pieces which required it.

All of the warrior-musicians invade into the audience space and engage in a through-composed battle choreography while octophonic electronic music of fighter jets and sound bombs resound throughout the auditorium.",

By then I was responsible for creating all of the synthesizer sounds for both the percussion and synth players of the two armies. The two synth players operated a ROLI Seaboard while the percussionists used a custom made drum pad. Overall more than 200 sounds of short \"war signals\" had to be created and balanced together with the brass players and electronic music.",

Hence, all of the sounds and synthesizers that were used back then were by now obsolete and had to be reconstructed. It is the first time the piece was performed since the original production and thus required a painstaking consultation with the original recordings, synthesizer cartridges, scores, correspondence with the original players and the Stockhausen Foundation, and an long process of tweaking and balancing the sounds during the rehearsals. In the end the new sounds had to mix well with the old ones while still sounding crystal clear and modern.",

For example, the piece ends with a section called ENTFÜHRUNG where the abducted children march and sing the EVA formula while the synthesizers play pointillistic sounds interspersed with bird calls. Many months before the actual performances I created those timbres based on Stockhausen's description in the score as sounding initially like antique cymbals and gradually becoming more synthetic in nature. I also hand-picked samples of bird calls that mixed well together with the pointillistic notes. Finally, during the rehearsals in The Hague and Amsterdam I used SPAT Revolution (bottom left picture) and constructed a LEMUR controller for the iPad (bottom right picture) so that I was able to move all the sounds in circular trajectories within the space of the auditorium which was gradually becoming more echoic and distant as the children disappeared.",

While the 4 soloists had to be individually amplified and panned, for the choir groups we used only two wireless microphones per group (DPA 4060 attached to the middle of the scalp of two singers in each group). The signal was sent to a computer running Altiverb and routed back to the speakers in the hall. In that way we managed to simulate a reverberant space without overly amplifying the choir singers."
